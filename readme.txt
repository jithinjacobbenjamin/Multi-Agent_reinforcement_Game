This Code was developed as a part of my Master's Non-Thesis project from New Mexico State University(NMSU)

<b>Abstract</b>
The focus of this project is based on the proposal by Dr. Robert Smits(Mathematics professor from NMSU) to develop a Multi-agent reinforcement learning game that can provide the support needed for finding the solution towards solving a nonlinear singular partial differential equation.
Here python is used as the programming language to implement the reinforcement learning game and we have used the Q-Table for teaching the agents to make appropriate actions towards achieving their goals.
We have used python OpenCV library to make visual feedback of the game that is being played and how the agent scores the goals and a final graph interface to represent the score of the agent at each iteration which can lead to the finding the solution for nonlinear singular partial differential equation.
